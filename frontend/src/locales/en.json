I'm 20 years old and I'm a Front-End developer. I started venturing into the world of web development on my own around the end of 2022. Since I was a child, I've always been fascinated by computers and astronomy, always wondering: \"how do these machines think?\" Oh, and I can't forget to mention that I have two kittens and a crazy dog (well, at least she's not really crazy, hehe). They keep me company during my long hours of coding!",
